## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```{r}
library('ISLR')
library('dplyr')
library('class')
library('gmodels') 
library('FNN')

#importing data set universitybank.csv

```{r}
UniversalBank<-read.csv('/Users/udaykirang/Downloads/UniversalBank.csv')
summary(UniversalBank)
```
```{r}
UniversalBank$ID<-NULL
UniversalBank$ZIP.Code<-NULL
summary(UniversalBank)
```
#Making the Personal Loan column as factor

```{r}
UniversalBank$Personal.Loan = as.factor(UniversalBank$Personal.Loan)
```

#Normalization
```{r}
Normal_Data <- preProcess(UniversalBank,method = "range") 
UniversalBank_Norm <- predict(Normal_Data,UniversalBank) 
summary(UniversalBank_Norm)
```
#Partition the data into training 60% and validation 40% sets
```{r}
Train_index <- createDataPartition(UniversalBank$Personal.Loan, p = 0.6, list = FALSE)
train.df = UniversalBank_Norm[Train_index,]
validation.df = UniversalBank_Norm[-Train_index,]
```
#Q1
#Classifying the customer as per the date provided
#Age = 40, Experience = 10, Income = 84, Family = 2, CCAvg = 2, Education_1 = 0, Education_2 = 1, Education_3 = 0, Mortgage = 0, Securities Account = 0, CD Account = 0, Online = 1, and Credit Card = 1. Perform a k-NN classification with all predictors except ID and ZIP code using k = 1. Remember to transform categorical predictors with more than two categories into dummy variables first. Specify the success class as 1 (loan acceptance), and use the default cutoff value of 0.5.

```{r}
To_Predict = data.frame(Age = 40, Experience = 10, Income = 84, Family = 2, CCAvg = 2, Education = 1, Mortgage = 0, Securities.Account = 0, CD.Account = 0, Online = 1, CreditCard = 1)
print(To_Predict)
```
```{r}
Prediction <- knn(train = train.df[,1:7],test = To_Predict[,1:7], cl = train.df$Personal.Loan, k = 1)
print(Prediction)
```
#Customer is classified as 1.

#Q2
#What is a choice of k that balances between overfitting and ignoring the predictor information?
#Calculating the accuracy for each value of k.
#Setting the range of k values.

```{r}
